            The dish in the picture is called chicharron con tostones and it is a popular dominican dish. chicharron is basically pork that is seasoned and fried until its crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. While tostones are basically sliced plantains that are also seasoned and fried until crispy on the outside. These 2 foods pair together well because they are both crunchy and savory.
